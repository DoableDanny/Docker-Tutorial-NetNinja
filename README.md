# Docker tutorial

Project built from following NetNinja Docker tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ieHmcTUOk&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hxjeEtdHFNYMtCpjNBm3h7&index=1

Comments/notes throughout this project are from me.

This project demonstrates how to dockerize an api and a react frontend, and use docker compose to run the two Dockerfiles and create images and containers for both the api and frontend.
